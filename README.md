# Neovim Config

**NOTE:** This repo is archived and will not be updated anymore. This is because I manage my config with home manager. The new/updated config now lives under [https://github.com/miampf/home-manager](https://github.com/miampf/home-manager).

A super simple neovim configuration. It uses [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as a plugin manager. The configuration should be pretty easy to understand, so I won't explain it here since I'm lazy. Keybindings can be found [here](./lua/config/keymap.lua).
